       sway - configuration file and commands

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       A sway configuration file is a list of sway commands that are executed by sway on startup.  These
       commands  usually consist of setting your preferences and setting key bindings. An example config
       is likely present in /etc/sway/config for you to check out.

       Lines in the configuration file might be extended through multiple lines by adding a '\'  charac‚Äê
       ter at the end of line. e.g.:

           bindsym Shift+XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec \
                pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -1%

       Commands  can  also be given as a block in the form [1mcommand { <subcommands...> }[22m. Anything before
       the opening [1m{ [22mwill be prepended to the lines inside the block. For example:

           output eDP-1 {
                background ~/wallpaper.png fill
                resolution 1920x1080
           }

       is identical to

           output eDP-1 background ~/wallpaper.png fill
           output eDP-1 resolution 1920x1080

       These commands can be executed in your config file, via [1mswaymsg[22m(1), or via the bindsym command.

[1mCOMMAND CONVENTIONS[0m
       Commands are split into several arguments using spaces. You can enclose arguments with  quotation
       marks  ([1m"..."  [22mor [1m'...'[22m) to add spaces to a single argument. You may also run several commands in
       order by separating each with [1m, [22mor [1m;[22m. Criteria is retained across commands separated  by  [1m,[22m,  but
       will be reset (and allow for new criteria, if desired) for commands separated by a [1m;[22m.

       Throughout  the  documentation, [1m| [22mis used to distinguish between arguments for which you may only
       select one. [1m[...] [22mis used for optional arguments, and [1m<...> [22mfor arguments where you are  expected
       to supply some value.

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       This  section  only lists general commands. For input and output commands, refer to [1msway-input[22m(5)
       and [1msway-output[22m(5).

       The following commands may only be used in the configuration file.

       [1mbar [22m[<bar-id>] <bar-subcommands...>
           For details on bar subcommands, see [1msway-bar[22m(5).

       [1mdefault_orientation [22mhorizontal|vertical|auto
           Sets the default container layout for tiled containers.

       [1minclude [22m<path>
           Includes another file from [4mpath[24m. [4mpath[24m can be either a full path or a  path  relative  to  the
           parent  config,  and expands shell syntax (see [1mwordexp[22m(3) for details). The same include file
           can only be included once; subsequent attempts will be ignored.

       [1mscratchpad_minimize [22menable|disable
           Adjusts if minimized windows should be moved into the scratchpad. Must be set at  config-time
           (when starting sway).

       [1mswaybg_command [22m<command>
           Executes  custom  background [4mcommand[24m. Default is [4mswaybg[24m. Refer to [1msway-output[22m(5) for more in‚Äê
           formation.

           It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: [4mswaybg_command[24m [4m-[0m

       [1mswaynag_command [22m<command>
           Executes custom command for [4mswaynag[24m. Default is [4mswaynag[24m. Additional arguments may be appended
           to the end. This should only be used to either direct sway to call swaynag from a custom path
           or to provide additional arguments. This should be placed at the top of the  config  for  the
           best results.

           It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: [4mswaynag_command[24m [4m-[0m

       [1mworkspace_layout [22mdefault|stacking|tabbed
           Specifies the initial layout for new containers in an empty workspace.

       [1mxwayland [22menable|disable|force
           Enables  or  disables Xwayland support, which allows X11 applications to be used. [4menable[24m will
           lazily load Xwayland so Xwayland will not be launched until the first client attempts to con‚Äê
           nect. In some cases, such as slower machines, it may be desirable to  have  Xwayland  started
           immediately by using [4mforce[24m instead of [4menable[24m.

       The following commands cannot be used directly in the configuration file. They are expected to be
       used with [1mbindsym [22mor at runtime through [1mswaymsg[22m(1).

       [1mborder [22mnone|normal|csd|pixel [<n>]
           Set border style for focused window. [4mnormal[24m includes a border of thickness [4mn[24m and a title bar.
           [4mpixel[24m  is  a border without title bar [4mn[24m pixels thick. Default is [4mnormal[24m with border thickness
           2. [4mcsd[24m is short for client-side-decorations, which allows the client to draw its own  decora‚Äê
           tions.

       [1mborder [22mtoggle
           Cycles through the available border styles.

       [1mexit[0m
           Exit sway and end your Wayland session.

       [1mfloating [22menable|disable|toggle
           Make focused view floating, non-floating, or the opposite of what it is now.

       <criteria> [1mfocus[0m
           Moves focus to the container that matches the specified criteria.

       [1mfocus [22mup|right|down|left
           Moves focus to the next container in the specified direction.

       [1mfocus [22mprev|next [sibling]
           Moves focus to the previous or next container in the current layout. By default, the last ac‚Äê
           tive  child  of the newly focused container will be focused. The [4msibling[24m option indicates not
           to immediately focus a child of the container.

       [1mfocus [22mchild
           Moves focus to the last-focused child of the focused container.

       [1mfocus [22mparent
           Moves focus to the parent of the focused container.

       [1mfocus [22moutput up|right|down|left
           Moves focus to the next output in the specified direction.

       [1mfocus [22moutput <name>
           Moves focus to the named output.

       [1mfocus [22mtiling
           Sets focus to the last focused tiling container.

       [1mfocus [22mfloating
           Sets focus to the last focused floating container.

       [1mfocus [22mmode_toggle
           Moves focus between the floating and tiled layers.

       [1mfullscreen [22m[enable|disable|toggle] [global]
           Makes focused view fullscreen, non-fullscreen, or the opposite of what it is now. If no argu‚Äê
           ment is given, it does the same  as  [4mtoggle[24m.  If  [4mglobal[24m  is  specified,  the  view  will  be
           fullscreen across all outputs.

       [1mgaps   [22minner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|right|bottom|left   all|current  set|plus|minus|toggle
       <amount>
           Changes the [4minner[24m or [4mouter[24m gaps for either [4mall[24m workspaces or  the  [4mcurrent[24m  workspace.  [4mouter[0m
           gaps can be altered per side with [4mtop[24m, [4mright[24m, [4mbottom[24m, and [4mleft[24m or per direction with [4mhorizon‚Äê[0m
           [4mtal[24m and [4mvertical[24m.

       [1minhibit_idle [22mfocus|fullscreen|open|none|visible
           Set/unset an idle inhibitor for the view. [4mfocus[24m will inhibit idle when the view is focused by
           any  seat.  [4mfullscreen[24m  will  inhibit  idle when the view is fullscreen (or a descendant of a
           fullscreen container) and is visible. [4mopen[24m will inhibit idle until the view is closed (or the
           inhibitor is unset/changed). [4mvisible[24m will inhibit idle when the view is visible on  any  out‚Äê
           put. [4mnone[24m will remove any existing idle inhibitor for the view.

           This  can  also  be used with criteria to set an idle inhibitor for any existing view or with
           [4mfor_window[24m to set idle inhibitors for future views.

       [1mlayout [22mdefault|splith|splitv|stacking|tabbed
           Sets the layout mode of the focused container.

           When using the [4mstacking[24m layout, only the focused window in the container is  displayed,  with
           the opened windows' list on the top of the container.

           The [4mtabbed[24m layout is similar to [4mstacking[24m, but the windows‚Äô list is vertically split.

       [1mlayout [22mtoggle [split|all]
           Cycles  the layout mode of the focused container though a preset list of layouts. If no argu‚Äê
           ment is given, then it cycles through stacking, tabbed and the last split layout. If [4msplit[24m is
           given, then it cycles through splith and splitv. If [4mall[24m is  given,  then  it  cycles  through
           every layout.

       [1mlayout [22mtoggle [split|tabbed|stacking|splitv|splith] [split|tabbed|stacking|splitv|splith]...
           Cycles the layout mode of the focused container through a list of layouts.

       [1mmax_render_time [22moff|<msec>
           Controls when the relevant application is told to render this window, as a positive number of
           milliseconds  before  the  next  time  sway  composites the output. A smaller number leads to
           fresher rendered frames being composited by sway and lower perceived input  latency,  but  if
           set  too  low,  the  application  may not finish rendering before sway composites the output,
           leading to delayed frames.

           When set to off, the relevant application is told to render  this  window  immediately  after
           display  refresh.  How  much  time is left for rendering before sway composites the output at
           that point depends on the output [1mmax_render_time [22msetting.

           To set this up for optimal latency:
           1.  Set up [1moutput max_render_time [22m(see [1msway-output[22m(5)).
           2.  Put the target application in [4mfull-screen[24m and have it continuously render something.
           3.  Start by setting [1mmax_render_time 1[22m. If the application drops frames, increment by [1m1[22m.

           This setting only has an effect if a per-output [1mmax_render_time [22mis in effect  on  the  output
           the window is currently on. See [1msway-output[22m(5) for further details.

       [1mmove [22mleft|right|up|down [<px> px]
           Moves  the  focused  container in the direction specified. The optional [4mpx[24m argument specifies
           how many pixels to move the container. If unspecified, the default is 10 pixels.  Pixels  are
           ignored when moving tiled containers.

       [1mmove [22m[absolute] position <pos_x> [px|ppt] <pos_y> [px|ppt]
           Moves  the  focused container to the specified position in the workspace. The position can be
           specified in pixels or percentage points, omitting the unit defaults to pixels.  If  [4mabsolute[0m
           is  used,  the  position is relative to all outputs. [4mabsolute[24m can not be used with percentage
           points.

       [1mmove [22m[absolute] position center
           Moves the focused container to be centered on the workspace. If [4mabsolute[24m is used, it is moved
           to the center of all outputs.

       [1mmove [22mposition cursor|mouse|pointer
           Moves the focused container to be centered on the cursor.

       [1mmove [22m[container|window] [to] mark <mark>
           Moves the focused container to the specified mark.

       [1mmove [22m[--no-auto-back-and-forth] [container|window] [to] workspace [number] <name>
           Moves the focused container to the specified workspace. The string [4mnumber[24m is optional and  is
           used to match a workspace with the same number, even if it has a different name.

       [1mmove [22m[container|window] [to] workspace prev|next|current
           Moves  the focused container to the previous, next or current workspace on this output, or if
           no workspaces remain, the previous or next output.

       [1mmove [22m[container|window] [to] workspace prev_on_output|next_on_output
           Moves the focused container to the previous or next workspace on this output, wrapping around
           if already at the first or last workspace.

       [1mmove [22m[container|window] [to] workspace back_and_forth
           Moves the focused container to previously focused workspace.

       [1mmove [22m[container|window] [to] output <name-or-id>|current
           Moves the focused container to the specified output.

       [1mmove [22m[container|window] [to] output up|right|down|left

       [1mmove [22m[container|window] [to] scratchpad
           Moves the focused container to the scratchpad.

       [1mmove [22mworkspace [to] output <name-or-id>|current
           Moves the focused workspace to the specified output.

       [1mmove [22mworkspace to [output] <name-or-id>|current
           Moves the focused workspace to the specified output.

       [1mmove [22mworkspace [to] output up|right|down|left
           Moves the focused workspace to next output in the specified direction.

       [1mmove [22mworkspace to [output] up|right|down|left
           Moves the focused workspace to next output in the specified direction.

       [1mnop [22m<comment>
           A no operation command that can be used to override default behaviour. The  optional  comment
           argument is ignored, but logged for debugging purposes.

       [1mreload[0m
           Reloads  the  sway  config  file  and applies any changes. The config file is located at path
           specified by the command line arguments when started, otherwise  according  to  the  priority
           stated in [1msway[22m(1).

       [1mrename [22mworkspace [<old_name>] to <new_name>
           Rename either <old_name> or the focused workspace to the <new_name>

       [1mresize [22mshrink|grow width|height [<amount> [px|ppt]]
           Resizes  the currently focused container by [4mamount[24m, specified in pixels or percentage points.
           If the units are omitted, floating containers are resized in px and tiled containers by  ppt.
           [4mamount[24m will default to 10 if omitted.

       [1mresize [22mset height <height> [px|ppt]
           Sets  the height of the container to [4mheight[24m, specified in pixels or percentage points. If the
           units are omitted, floating containers are resized in px and  tiled  containers  by  ppt.  If
           [4mheight[24m is 0, the container will not be resized.

       [1mresize [22mset [width] <width> [px|ppt]
           Sets  the  width  of the container to [4mwidth[24m, specified in pixels or percentage points. If the
           units are omitted, floating containers are resized in px and  tiled  containers  by  ppt.  If
           [4mwidth[24m is 0, the container will not be resized.

       [1mresize [22mset [width] <width> [px|ppt] [height] <height> [px|ppt]
           Sets  the  width and height of the container to [4mwidth[24m and [4mheight[24m, specified in pixels or per‚Äê
           centage points. If the units are omitted, floating containers are resized  in  px  and  tiled
           containers by ppt. If [4mwidth[24m or [4mheight[24m is 0, the container will not be resized on that axis.

       [1mscratchpad [22mshow
           Shows a window from the scratchpad. Repeatedly using this command will cycle through the win‚Äê
           dows in the scratchpad.

       [1mshortcuts_inhibitor [22menable|disable
           Enables  or disables the ability of clients to inhibit keyboard shortcuts for a view. This is
           primarily useful for virtualization and remote desktop software. It affects either  the  cur‚Äê
           rently  focused  view or a set of views selected by criteria. Subcommand [4mdisable[24m additionally
           deactivates any active inhibitors for the given view(s).  Criteria  are  particularly  useful
           with  the  [1mfor_window [22mcommand to configure a class of views differently from the per-seat de‚Äê
           faults established by the [1mseat [22msubcommand of the same name. See [1msway-input[22m(5) for  more  ways
           to affect inhibitors.

       [1msplit [22mvertical|v|horizontal|h|none|n|toggle|t
           Splits  the current container, vertically or horizontally. When [4mnone[24m is specified, the effect
           of a previous split is undone if the current container is the only child of a  split  parent.
           When  [4mtoggle[24m  is specified, the current container is split opposite to the parent container's
           layout.

       [1msplith[0m
           Equivalent to [1msplit horizontal[0m

       [1msplitv[0m
           Equivalent to [1msplit vertical[0m

       [1msplitt[0m
           Equivalent to [1msplit toggle[0m

       [1msticky [22menable|disable|toggle
           "Sticks" a floating window to the current output so that it shows up on all workspaces.

       [1mswap [22mcontainer with id|con_id|mark <arg>
           Swaps the position, geometry, and fullscreen status of two containers.  The  first  container
           can  be  selected  either  by  criteria or focus. The second container can be selected by [4mid[24m,
           [4mcon_id[24m, or [4mmark[24m. [4mid[24m can only be used with xwayland views. If the first container  has  focus,
           it  will retain focus unless it is moved to a different workspace or the second container be‚Äê
           comes fullscreen on the same workspace as the first container. In either of those cases,  the
           second container will gain focus.

       [1mtitle_format [22m<format>
           Sets the format of window titles. The following placeholders may be used:

               %title - The title supplied by the window
                         %app_id - The wayland app ID (applicable to wayland windows only)
                         %class - The X11 classname (applicable to xwayland windows only)
                         %instance - The X11 instance (applicable to xwayland windows only)
                         %shell - The protocol the window is using (typically xwayland or
                   xdg_shell)

           This command is typically used with [1mfor_window [22mcriteria. For example:

               for_window [title="."] title_format "<b>%title</b> (%app_id)"

           Note that markup requires pango to be enabled via the [1mfont [22mcommand.

           The default format is "%title".

       The following commands may be used either in the configuration file or at runtime.

       [1massign [22m<criteria> [‚Üí] [workspace] [number] <workspace>
           Assigns  views  matching  [4mcriteria[24m (see [1mCRITERIA [22mfor details) to [4mworkspace[24m. The ‚Üí (U+2192) is
           optional and cosmetic. This command is equivalent to:

           Binds  [4mkey[24m  [4mcombo[24m to execute the sway command [4mcommand[24m when pressed. You may use XKB key names
           here ([1mwev[22m(1) is a good tool for discovering these). With the flag [4m--release[24m, the  command  is
           executed  when  the key combo is released. If [4minput-device[24m is given, the binding will only be
           executed for that input device and will be executed instead of any binding that is generic to
           all devices. If a group number is given, then the binding will only  be  available  for  that
           group.  By  default,  if you overwrite a binding, swaynag will give you a warning. To silence
           this, use the [4m--no-warn[24m flag.

           Unless the flag [4m--locked[24m is set, the command will not be run when a screen locking program is
           active. If there is a matching binding with and without [4m--locked[24m, the one with will  be  pre‚Äê
           ferred when locked and the one without will be preferred when unlocked. If there are matching
           bindings  and  one has both [4m--input-device[24m and [4m--locked[24m and the other has neither, the former
           will be preferred even when unlocked.

           Unless the flag [4m--inhibited[24m is set, the command will not be run when a keyboard shortcuts in‚Äê
           hibitor is active for the currently focused window. Such inhibitors are usually requested  by
           remote  desktop  and virtualization software to enable the user to send keyboard shortcuts to
           the remote or virtual session. The [4m--inhibited[24m flag allows one to define bindings which  will
           be  exempt  from pass-through to such software. The same preference logic as for [4m--locked[24m ap‚Äê
           plies.

           Unless the flag [4m--no-repeat[24m is set, the command will be run repeatedly when the key is  held,
           according to the repeat settings specified in the input configuration.

           Bindings  to  keysyms  are  layout-dependent. This can be changed with the [4m--to-code[24m flag. In
           this case, the keysyms will be translated into the corresponding keycodes in the  first  con‚Äê
           figured layout.

           Mouse  bindings  operate  on the container under the cursor instead of the container that has
           focus. Mouse buttons can either be specified in the form [4mbutton[1-9][24m or by using the name  of
           the  event code (ex [4mBTN_LEFT[24m or [4mBTN_RIGHT[24m). For the former option, the buttons will be mapped
           to their values in X11 (1=left, 2=middle, 3=right, 4=scroll up, 5=scroll down, 6=scroll left,
           7=scroll right, 8=back, 9=forward). For the latter option, you can find the event names using
           [4mlibinput[24m [4mdebug-events[24m.

           The priority for matching bindings is as follows: input device, group, and locked state.

           [4m--whole-window[24m, [4m--border[24m, and [4m--exclude-titlebar[24m are mouse-only options which affect the  re‚Äê
           gion in which the mouse bindings can be triggered.  By default, mouse bindings are only trig‚Äê
           gered when over the title bar. With the [4m--border[24m option, the border of the window will be in‚Äê
           cluded in this region. With the [4m--whole-window[24m option, the cursor can be anywhere over a win‚Äê
           dow  including  the title, border, and content. [4m--exclude-titlebar[24m can be used in conjunction
           with any other option to specify that the titlebar should be excluded from the region of con‚Äê
           sideration.

           If [4m--whole-window[24m is given, the command can be triggered when the cursor  is  over  an  empty
           workspace.  Using  a  mouse  binding over a layer surface's exclusive region is not currently
           possible.

           Example:
                     # Execute firefox when alt, shift, and f are pressed together
                     bindsym Mod1+Shift+f exec firefox

           vice=<device>] [--no-warn] [--no-repeat] [--inhibited] [Group<1-4>+]<code> <command> is  also
           available for binding with key/button codes instead of key/button names.

       [1mbindswitch [22m[--locked] [--no-warn] [--reload] <switch>:<state> <command>
           Binds  <switch>  to execute the sway command [4mcommand[24m on state changes. Supported switches are
           [4mlid[24m (laptop lid) and [4mtablet[24m (tablet mode) switches. Valid values for [4mstate[24m are  [4mon[24m,  [4moff[24m  and
           [4mtoggle[24m.  These switches are on when the device lid is shut and when tablet mode is active re‚Äê
           spectively. [4mtoggle[24m is also supported to run a command both when the switch is toggled  on  or
           off.

           Unless the flag [4m--locked[24m is set, the command will not be run when a screen locking program is
           active.  If  there is a matching binding with and without [4m--locked[24m, the one with will be pre‚Äê
           ferred when locked and the one without will be preferred when unlocked.

           If the [4m--reload[24m flag is given, the binding will also be executed when the config is reloaded.
           [4mtoggle[24m bindings will not be executed on reload. The [4m--locked[24m flag will operate as  normal  so
           if the config is reloaded while locked and [4m--locked[24m is not given, the binding will not be ex‚Äê
           ecuted.

           By default, if you overwrite a binding, swaynag will give you a warning. To silence this, use
           the [4m--no-warn[24m flag.

           Example:
                     # Show the virtual keyboard when tablet mode is entered.
                     bindswitch tablet:on busctl call --user sm.puri.OSK0 /sm/puri/OSK0 sm.puri.OSK0 SetVisible b true

                     # Log a message when the laptop lid is opened or closed.
                     bindswitch lid:toggle exec echo "Lid moved"

           The  [4mfingers[24m can be limited to any sensible number or left empty to accept any finger counts.
           Valid directions are [4mup[24m, [4mdown[24m, [4mleft[24m and [4mright[24m, as well as [4minward[24m, [4moutward[24m,  [4mclockwise[24m,  [4mcoun‚Äê[0m
           [4mterclockwise[24m for the [4mpinch[24m gesture. Multiple directions can be combined by a plus.

           If  a [4minput-device[24m is given, the binding will only be executed for that input device and will
           be executed instead of any binding that is generic to all devices. By default, if  you  over‚Äê
           write a binding, swaynag will give you a warning. To silence this, use the [4m--no-warn[24m flag.

           The  [4m--exact[24m flag can be used to ensure a binding only matches when exactly all specified di‚Äê
           rections are matched and nothing more. If there is matching binding with [4m--exact[24m, it will  be
           preferred.

           The  priority  for matching bindings is as follows: input device, then exact matches followed
           by matches with the highest number of matching directions.

           Gestures executed while the pointer is above a bar are not handled by sway. See  the  respec‚Äê
           tive documentation, e.g. [1mbindgesture [22min [1msway-bar[22m(5).

           The available classes are:

           [1mclient.focused[0m
               The window that has focus.

           [1mclient.focused_inactive[0m
               The most recently focused view within a container which is not focused.

           [1mclient.focused_tab_title[0m
               A  view  that  has focused descendant container. Tab or stack container title that is the
               parent of the focused container but is not directly focused. Defaults to focused_inactive
               if not specified and does not use the indicator and child_border colors.

           [1mclient.placeholder[0m
               Ignored (present for i3 compatibility).

           [1mclient.unfocused[0m
               A view that does not have focus.

           [1mclient.urgent[0m
               A view with an urgency hint. [1mNote[22m: Native Wayland windows do not support urgency. Urgency
               only works for Xwayland windows.

           The meaning of each color is:

           [4mborder[0m
               The border around the title bar.

           [4mbackground[0m
               The background of the title bar.

           [4mtext[0m
               The text color of the title bar.

           [4mindicator[0m
               The color used to indicate where a new view will open. In a tiled container,  this  would
               paint the right border of the current view if a new view would be opened to the right.

           [4mchild_border[0m
               The border around the view itself.

       [1mfocus_on_window_activation [22msmart|urgent|focus|none
           This option determines what to do when a client requests window activation. If set to [4murgent[24m,
           the urgent state will be set for that window. If set to [4mfocus[24m, the  window  will  become  fo‚Äê

       [1mfocus_wrapping [22myes|no|force|workspace
           This option determines what to do when attempting to focus over the edge of a  container.  If
           set  to  [4mno[24m, the focused container will retain focus, if there are no other containers in the
           direction. If set to [4myes[24m, focus will be wrapped to the opposite edge  of  the  container,  if
           there are no other containers in the direction. If set to [4mforce[24m, focus will be wrapped to the
           opposite  edge  of the container, even if there are other containers in the direction. If set
           to [4mworkspace[24m, focus will wrap like in the [4myes[24m case and additionally wrap when moving  outside
           of workspaces boundaries. Default is [4myes[24m.

       [1mfont [22m[pango:]<font>
           Sets  font  to  use  for the title bars. To enable support for pango markup, preface the font
           name with [4mpango:[24m. For example, [4mmonospace[24m [4m10[24m is the default font. To enable support for  pango
           markup,  [4mpango:monospace[24m [4m10[24m should be used instead. Regardless of whether pango markup is en‚Äê
           abled, [4mfont[24m should be specified as a pango font description. For more  information  on  pango
           font        descriptions,        see        https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/type_func.FontDescrip‚Äê

       [1mforce_display_urgency_hint [22m<timeout> [ms]
           If an application on another workspace sets an urgency hint, switching to this workspace  may
           lead  to  immediate  focus  of  the application, which also means the window decoration color
           would be immediately reset to [1mclient.focused[22m. This may make it  unnecessarily  hard  to  tell
           which  window  originally  raised the event. This option allows one to set a [4mtimeout[24m in ms to
           delay the urgency hint reset.

       [1mtitlebar_padding [22m<horizontal> [<vertical>]
           Padding of the text in the titlebar. [4mhorizontal[24m value affects horizontal padding of the  text
           while  [4mvertical[24m value affects vertical padding (space above and below text). Padding includes
           titlebar borders so their value should be greater than titlebar_border_thickness. If [4mvertical[0m
           value is not specified it is set to the [4mhorizontal[24m value.  If  [4mcorner_radius[24m  is  set  to  be
           greater  than  the  [4mhorizontal[24m  or  [4mvertical[24m value, the value will be treated as that of [4mcor‚Äê[0m

           Determines what to do when a fullscreen view opens a dialog. If [4msmart[24m (the default), the dia‚Äê
           log  will  be displayed. If [4mignore[24m, the dialog will not be rendered. If [4mleave_fullscreen[24m, the
           view will exit fullscreen mode and the dialog will be rendered.

       [1mprimary_selection [22menabled|disabled
           Enable or disable the primary selection clipboard. May only be configured at launch.  Default
           is [4menabled[24m.

       [1mset [22m$<name> <value>
           Sets  variable  $[4mname[24m  to [4mvalue[24m. You can use the new variable in the arguments of future com‚Äê
           mands. When the variable is used, it can be escaped with an additional $ (ie $$[4mname[24m) to  have
           the  replacement  happen at run time instead of when reading the config. However, it does not
           always make sense for the variable to be replaced at run time since some arguments do need to
           be known at config time.

       [1mshow_marks [22myes|no
           If [1mshow_marks [22mis yes, marks will be displayed in the window borders.  Any  mark  that  starts
           with an underscore will not be drawn even if [1mshow_marks [22mis yes. The default is [4myes[24m.

       [1mopacity [22m[set|plus|minus] <value>
           Adjusts  the  opacity  of  the  window  between  0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely
           opaque). If the operation is omitted, [4mset[24m will be used.

       [1msaturation [22m[set|plus|minus] <value>
           Adjusts the saturation (Digital Vibrance) of the window between 0 (black  and  white)  and  2
           (over saturated which is suited for some FPS games) while 1 is the default saturation. If the
           operation is omitted, [4mset[24m will be used.

       [1mtiling_drag  [22menable|disable|toggle
           Sets  whether  or  not tiling containers can be dragged with the mouse. If [4menabled[24m (default),
           the [4mfloating_mod[24m can be used to drag tiling, as well as floating, containers. Using the  left
           mouse  button  on  title  bars  without  the [4mfloating_mod[24m will also allow the container to be
           dragged. [4mtoggle[24m should not be used in the config file.

       [1mtiling_drag_threshold [22m<threshold>
           Sets the threshold that must be exceeded for a container to be dragged by its titlebar.  This
           has  no effect if [4mfloating_mod[24m is used or if [4mtiling_drag[24m is set to [4mdisable[24m.  Once the thresh‚Äê
           old has been exceeded once, the drag starts and the cursor can come back inside the threshold
           without stopping the drag.  [4mthreshold[24m is multiplied by the scale of the output that the  cur‚Äê
           sor on.  The default is 9.

       [1mtitle_align [22mleft|center|right
           Sets  the  title alignment. If [4mright[24m is selected and [4mshow_marks[24m is set to [4myes[24m, the marks will
           be shown on the [4mleft[24m side instead of the [4mright[24m side.

       [1munbindswitch [22m<switch>:<state>
           Removes a binding for when <switch> changes to <state>.

       [1munbindgesture [22m[--exact] [--input-device=<device>] <gesture>[:<fingers>][:directions]
           Removes a binding for the specified [4mgesture[24m, [4mfingers[24m and [4mdirections[24m combination.

       [1munbindsym [22m[--whole-window] [--border]  [--exclude-titlebar]  [--release]  [--locked]  [--to-code]
       [--input-device=<device>] <key combo>
           Removes  the binding for [4mkey[24m [4mcombo[24m that was previously bound with the given flags.  If [4minput-[0m
           [4mdevice[24m is given, only the binding for that input device will be unbound.

           [1munbindcode [22m[--whole-window] [--border] [--exclude-titlebar] [--release] [--locked]  [--input-
           device=<device>]  <code>  is  also  available  for unbinding with key/button codes instead of
           key/button names.

       [1munmark [22m[<identifier>]
           [1munmark [22mwill remove [4midentifier[24m from the list of current marks on a window.  If  [4midentifier[24m  is
           omitted, all marks are removed.

       [1murgent [22menable|disable|allow|deny
           Using  [4menable[24m  or  [4mdisable[24m  manually sets or unsets the window's urgent state. Using [4mallow[24m or
           [4mdeny[24m controls the window's ability to set itself as urgent. By default, windows  are  allowed
           to set their own urgency.

       [1mworkspace [22m[--no-auto-back-and-forth] [number] <[num:]name>
           Switches  to  the  specified  workspace. The [4mnum:[24m portion of the name is optional and will be
           used for ordering. If [4mnum:[24m is not given and [4mname[24m is a number, then it will be  also  be  used
           for ordering.

           If the [4mno-auto-back-and-forth[24m option is given, then this command will not perform a back-and-
           forth  operation  when  the workspace is already focused and [4mworkspace_auto_back_and_forth[24m is
           enabled.

           If the [4mnumber[24m keyword is specified and a workspace with the number already exists,  then  the
           workspace  with the number will be used. If a workspace with the number does not exist, a new
           workspace will be created with the name [4mname[24m.

       [1mworkspace [22mprev|next
           Switches to the next workspace on the current output or on the next output  if  currently  on
           the last workspace.

       [1mworkspace [22mprev_on_output|next_on_output
           Switches to the next workspace on the current output.

       [1mworkspace [22mback_and_forth
           Switches to the previously focused workspace.

       [1mworkspace [22m<name> gaps inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|right|bottom|left <amount>
           Specifies that workspace [4mname[24m should have the given gaps settings when it is created.

           This command does not affect existing workspaces. To alter the gaps of an existing workspace,
           use the [4mgaps[24m command.

       [1mworkspace [22m<name> output <outputs...>
           Specifies  that workspace [4mname[24m should be shown on the specified [4moutputs[24m. Multiple outputs can
           be listed and the first available will be used. If the workspace gets  placed  on  an  output
           further  down  the list and an output that is higher on the list becomes available, the work‚Äê
           space will be moved to the higher priority output.

           This command does not affect existing workspaces. To move an existing workspace, use the [4mmove[0m
           command in combination with the [4mworkspace[24m criteria (non-empty workspaces only)  or  [4mworkspace[0m
           command (to switch to the workspace before moving).

       [1mworkspace_auto_back_and_forth [22myes|no
           When  [4myes[24m,  repeating a workspace switch command will switch back to the prior workspace. For
           example, if you are currently on workspace 1, switch to workspace 2, then  invoke  the  [1mwork‚Äê[0m
           [1mspace 2 [22mcommand again, you will be returned to workspace 1. Default is [4mno[24m.

[1mCRITERIA[0m
       A criteria is a string in the form of, for example:

           [class="[Rr]egex.*" title="some title"]

       The  string  contains  one or more (space separated) attribute/value pairs. They are used by some
       commands to choose which views to execute actions on. All attributes must match for the  criteria
       to match. Criteria is retained across commands separated by a [1m,[22m, but will be reset (and allow for
       new criteria, if desired) for commands separated by a [1m;[22m.

       Criteria  may be used with either the [1mfor_window [22mor [1massign [22mcommands to specify operations to per‚Äê
       form on new views. A criteria may also be used to perform specific commands (ones  that  normally
       act upon one window) on all views that match that criteria. For example:

       Focus on a window with the mark "IRC":

           [con_mark="IRC"] focus

       Kill all windows with the title "Emacs":

           [class="Emacs"] kill

       You  may  like  to use swaymsg -t get_tree for finding the values of these properties in practice
       for your applications.

       The following attributes may be matched with:
